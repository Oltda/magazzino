# Warehouse Management App

I created this app for a friend who opened a small business and needed a simple CRUD application 
to keep record of the available stock. One of the features of this app is an automatic expiration date
checker that notifies the user 10 days before the expiration date of a stock item.

For a better user experience, I implemented Ajax for http requests.

Tech stack:
        - backend: Python - Flask framework, PostgreSQL database <br />
        - frontend: vanilla javaScript, HTML, CSS
